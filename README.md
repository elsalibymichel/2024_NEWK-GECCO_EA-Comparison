# 2024_NEWK-GECCO_EA-Comparison

This repo contains the tools and data needed to replicate the results of the research paper 
[*Eventually, All You Need is a Simple Evolutionary Algorithm
(for Neuroevolution of Continuous Control Policies*](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/publications/2024-c-ensm-eventually/)
published by the NEWK workshop of the GECCO conference in 2021.
The paper contains all the details of the experiments configurations and the java frameworks we used.

In this repo we provide the data resulting from the experiments and the Jupyter notebooks 
we used to analyze them. The Files are organised by scenario, following the nomenclature used in the paper.
